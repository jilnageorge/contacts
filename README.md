# contacts
A simple application using metawidget 

This is a single page prototype which uses Metawidget along with vanila javascript to collect contact details of people. The data is sent over REST api and saved in H2 Database.

This can be further enhanced by adding styles to the pages, and adding more features on the front-end like collecting more details and displaying it back after save, serach option etc. 

Back-end is done as a sprint boot application which uses one to many relations. 

Comments are not added as the code itself explains the purpose.
